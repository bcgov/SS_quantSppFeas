Quantitative analyses on current historical tree species environmental suitability

## Readme 
This repository holds data, scripts, model outputs and figures of preliminary analyses of species abundance and climatic suitability predictions for BC tree species at the BEC site-series level.

## Usage
Current scripting workflows for 1) Species suitability & abundance modeling with Bayesian analysis and 2) Species Abundance modeling with random forest can be found in the scripts folder README 

## Requirements
R 4.0 or greater, brms, ranger, tidyverse  

## Project Status
In process 

## Goals/Roadmap
Quantitatively inform and validate expert derived BC tree species suitability ratings for downstream use in Climate Change Informed Species Selection (CCISS) 

Develop site-specific (micro-climatically relevant) species distribution/suitability models using the BEC Provincial plot dataset
