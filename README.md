Quantitative analyses on current species/site feasibility

---
## Readme 
---
This repository holds data, scripts, model outputs and figures of preliminary analyses of species distribution and climatic suitability predictions for BC tree species at the BEC site-series level.

## Features
TBD

## Usage
TBD

## Requirements
TBD

## Installation
TBD

## Project Status
Initializing 

## Goals/Roadmap
Inform and refine current BC species feasibility tables including CFRG and ecological feasibility tables for downstream use in Climate Change Informed Species Selection (CCISS) tools

Develop site-specific (micro-climatically relevant) species distribution/suitability models
